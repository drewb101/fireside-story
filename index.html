    <p>Night came and they decided to start telling ghost stories around the campfire.</p>
    <p>As Mike began telling his story about a masked killer with a machete,
      they heard a rusting in the bushes close by...</p>
    <p>Chris shouted out, "Who's there!?" As he did a shaggy but firendly stray dog jumped out of the bushes, much to the relief of the scared group imaganing a masked killer with a machete.</p>
